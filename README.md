- **Click Rate**: Z = -5.27, p < 0.001  
- **Subscribe Rate**: Z = -3.17, p = 0.0015

###  Logistic Regression

- Variables: `group`, `device`, `age_group`, `source`, `opened`, `clicked`
- Strong predictive power, quasi-separation indicates behavior-driven conversion
- Interaction terms added to test treatment effect across user segments

---

### Segmented Funnel Insights

-  **Mobile users** and  **users aged 25â€“44** responded best
- **Mobile-Treatment group**: 1.35% vs 0.61% in control
- Treatment effect most noticeable in age group **35â€“44**
